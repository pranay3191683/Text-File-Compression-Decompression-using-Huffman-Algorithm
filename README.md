It is a text file, script file Compression and Decompression Program which uses Huffman Algorithm for Compression and Decompression

For Compression -
1.Run compress.exe or compile source code
2.Enter name of file to compress
3.It generates the compressed file by (.cmp) and code.txt

**Note - Compressed File generated after compression will have .cmp extension amd Code.txt which contains character and their huffmanCodes which later helps in decompressing

For Decompression -
1.Run decompress.exe or compile source code
2.Enter Code.txt file to show the huffmandecodingtree
3.Enter same file name with .cmp extension e.g. - abc.cmp
